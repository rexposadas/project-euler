=============

My answers to some Project Euler problems.

Ref: http://projecteuler.net/

The files are prefixed by the problem number in the Project Euler list.

i.e. Problem 1 is prefixed with a number one. i.e. 1ThreeAndFive.go

Running the examples.

1. Setup a GO environment: http://golang.org/doc/install#install
2. go build <filename>
3. run the executable produced by the build command.

Example:
1. go build 1ThreeAndFive.go
2. ./ThreeAndFive.go
